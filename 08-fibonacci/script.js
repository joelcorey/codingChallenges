// a. A series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci numberÂ ) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The simplest is the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc.
// b. Write a function that does the Fibonacci sequence starting at 1
// c. HARDER VERSION: Write a function that does the Fibonacci sequence starting at a number that a user inputs
